## Chapter 5: Patterns and troubleshooting

These patterns emerged from skills created by early adopters and internal teams. They represent common approaches we've seen work well, not prescriptive templates.

### Choosing your approach: Problem-first vs. tool-first

Think of it like Home Depot. You might walk in with a problem - "I need to fix a kitchen cabinet" - and an employee points you to the right tools. Or you might pick out a new drill and ask how to use it for your specific job.

Skills work the same way:

- **Problem-first:** "I need to set up a project workspace" -> Your skill orchestrates the right MCP calls in the right sequence. Users describe outcomes; the skill handles the tools.
- **Tool-first:** "I have Notion MCP connected" -> Your skill teaches Claude the optimal workflows and best practices. Users have access; the skill provides expertise.

Most skills lean one direction. Knowing which framing fits your use case helps you choose the right pattern below.

### Pattern 1: Sequential workflow orchestration

**Use when:** Your users need multi-step processes in a specific order.

**Example structure:**

```markdown
## Workflow: Onboard New Customer

### Step 1: Create Account
Call MCP tool: `create_customer`
Parameters: name, email, company

### Step 2: Setup Payment
Call MCP tool: `setup_payment_method`
Wait for: payment method verification

### Step 3: Create Subscription
Call MCP tool: `create_subscription`
Parameters: plan_id, customer_id (from Step 1)

### Step 4: Send Welcome Email
Call MCP tool: `send_email`
Template: welcome_email_template
```

**Key techniques:**

- Explicit step ordering
- Dependencies between steps
- Validation at each stage
- Rollback instructions for failures

### Pattern 2: Multi-MCP coordination

**Use when:** Workflows span multiple services.

**Example: Design-to-development handoff**

```markdown
### Phase 1: Design Export (Figma MCP)
1. Export design assets from Figma
2. Generate design specifications
3. Create asset manifest

### Phase 2: Asset Storage (Drive MCP)
1. Create project folder in Drive
2. Upload all assets
3. Generate shareable links

### Phase 3: Task Creation (Linear MCP)
1. Create development tasks
2. Attach asset links to tasks
3. Assign to engineering team

### Phase 4: Notification (Slack MCP)
1. Post handoff summary to #engineering
2. Include asset links and task references
```

**Key techniques:**

- Clear phase separation
- Data passing between MCPs
- Validation before moving to next phase
- Centralized error handling

### Pattern 3: Iterative refinement

**Use when:** Output quality improves with iteration.

**Example: Report generation**

```markdown
## Iterative Report Creation

### Initial Draft
1. Fetch data via MCP
2. Generate first draft report
3. Save to temporary file

### Quality Check
1. Run validation script: `scripts/check_report.py`
2. Identify issues:
   - Missing sections
   - Inconsistent formatting
   - Data validation errors

### Refinement Loop
1. Address each identified issue
2. Regenerate affected sections
3. Re-validate
4. Repeat until quality threshold met

### Finalization
1. Apply final formatting
2. Generate summary
3. Save final version
```

**Key techniques:**

- Explicit quality criteria
- Iterative improvement
- Validation scripts
- Know when to stop iterating

### Pattern 4: Context-aware tool selection

**Use when:** Same outcome, different tools depending on context.

**Example: File storage**

```markdown
## Smart File Storage

### Decision Tree
1. Check file type and size
2. Determine best storage location:
   - Large files (>10MB): Use cloud storage MCP
   - Collaborative docs: Use Notion/Docs MCP
   - Code files: Use GitHub MCP
   - Temporary files: Use local storage

### Execute Storage
Based on decision:
- Call appropriate MCP tool
- Apply service-specific metadata
- Generate access link

### Provide Context to User
Explain why storage was chosen
```

**Key techniques:**

- Clear decision criteria
- Fallback options
- Transparency about choices

### Pattern 5: Domain-specific intelligence

**Use when:** Your skill adds specialized knowledge beyond tool access.

**Example: Financial compliance**

```markdown
## Payment Processing with Compliance

### Before Processing (Compliance Check)
1. Fetch transaction details via MCP
2. Apply compliance rules:
   - Check sanctions lists
   - Verify jurisdiction allowances
   - Assess risk level
3. Document compliance decision

### Processing
IF compliance passed:
  - Call payment processing MCP tool
  - Apply appropriate fraud checks
  - Process transaction
ELSE:
  - Flag for review
  - Create compliance case

### Audit Trail
- Log all compliance checks
- Record processing decisions
- Generate audit report
```

**Key techniques:**

- Domain expertise embedded in logic
- Compliance before action
- Comprehensive documentation
- Clear governance

## Troubleshooting

### Skill won't upload

**Error: "Could not find SKILL.md in uploaded folder"**

**Cause:** File not named exactly SKILL.md

**Solution:**

- Rename to SKILL.md (case-sensitive)
- Verify with: ls -la should show SKILL.md

**Error: "Invalid frontmatter"**

**Cause:** YAML formatting issue

Common mistakes:

```yaml
# Wrong - missing delimiters
name: my-skill
description: Does things

# Wrong - unclosed quotes
name: my-skill
description: "Does things

# Correct
---
name: my-skill
description: Does things
---
```

**Error: "Invalid skill name"**

**Cause:** Name has spaces or capitals

```yaml
# Wrong
name: My Cool Skill

# Correct
name: my-cool-skill
```

### Skill doesn't trigger

**Symptom:** Skill never loads automatically

**Fix:**

Revise your description field. See [The Description Field](#the-description-field) for good/bad examples.

**Quick checklist:**

- Is it too generic? ("Helps with projects" won't work)
- Does it include trigger phrases users would actually say?
- Does it mention relevant file types if applicable?

**Debugging approach:**

Ask Claude: "When would you use the [skill name] skill?" Claude will quote the description back. Adjust based on what's missing.

### Skill triggers too often

**Symptom:** Skill loads for unrelated queries

**Solutions:**

1. **Add negative triggers**

```
description: Advanced data analysis for CSV files. Use for statistical modeling, regression, clustering. Do NOT use for simple data exploration (use data-viz skill instead).
```

2. **Be more specific**

```yaml
# Too broad
description: Processes documents

# More specific
description: Processes PDF legal documents for contract review
```

3. **Clarify scope**

```
description: PayFlow payment processing for e-commerce. Use specifically for online payment workflows, not for general financial queries.
```

### MCP connection issues

**Symptom:** Skill loads but MCP calls fail

**Checklist:**

1. **Verify MCP server is connected**
   - Claude.ai: Settings > Extensions > [Your Service]
   - Should show "Connected" status

2. **Check authentication**
   - API keys valid and not expired
   - Proper permissions/scopes granted
   - OAuth tokens refreshed

3. **Test MCP independently**
   - Ask Claude to call MCP directly (without skill)
   - "Use [Service] MCP to fetch my projects"
   - If this fails, issue is MCP not skill

4. **Verify tool names**
   - Skill references correct MCP tool names
   - Check MCP server documentation
   - Tool names are case-sensitive

### Instructions not followed

**Symptom:** Skill loads but Claude doesn't follow instructions

**Common causes:**

1. **Instructions too verbose**
   - Keep instructions concise
   - Use bullet points and numbered lists
   - Move detailed reference to separate files

2. **Instructions buried**
   - Put critical instructions at the top
   - Use ## Important or ## Critical headers
   - Repeat key points if needed

3. **Ambiguous language**

```
# Bad
Make sure to validate things properly

# Good
CRITICAL: Before calling create_project, verify:
- Project name is non-empty
- At least one team member assigned
- Start date is not in the past
```

**Advanced technique:** For critical validations, consider bundling a script that performs the checks programmatically rather than relying on language instructions. Code is deterministic; language interpretation isn't. See the [Office skills](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/skills/skills) for examples of this pattern.

4. **Model "laziness"** Add explicit encouragement:

```markdown
## Performance Notes
- Take your time to do this thoroughly
- Quality is more important than speed
- Do not skip validation steps
```

Note: Adding this to user prompts is more effective than in SKILL.md

### Large context issues

**Symptom:** Skill seems slow or responses degraded

**Causes:**

- Skill content too large
- Too many skills enabled simultaneously
- All content loaded instead of progressive disclosure

**Solutions:**

1. **Optimize SKILL.md size**
   - Move detailed docs to references/
   - Link to references instead of inline
   - Keep SKILL.md under 5,000 words

2. **Reduce enabled skills**
   - Evaluate if you have more than 20 - 50 skills enabled simultaneously
   - Recommend selective enablement
   - Consider skill "packs" for related capabilities
