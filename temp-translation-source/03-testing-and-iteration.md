## Chapter 3: Testing and iteration

Skills can be tested at varying levels of rigor depending on your needs:

- **Manual testing in Claude.ai** - Run queries directly and observe behavior. Fast iteration, no setup required.
- **Scripted testing in Claude Code** - Automate test cases for repeatable validation across changes.
- **Programmatic testing via skills API** - Build evaluation suites that run systematically against defined test sets.

Choose the approach that matches your quality requirements and the visibility of your skill. A skill used internally by a small team has different testing needs than one deployed to thousands of enterprise users.

> **Pro Tip:** Iterate on a single task before expanding

We've found that the most effective skill creators iterate on a single challenging task until Claude succeeds, then extract the winning approach into a skill. This leverages Claude's in-context learning and provides faster signal than broad testing. Once you have a working foundation, expand to multiple test cases for coverage.

### Recommended Testing Approach

Based on early experience, effective skills testing typically covers three areas:

#### 1. Triggering tests

**Goal:** Ensure your skill loads at the right times.

**Test cases:**

- ✅ Triggers on obvious tasks
- ✅ Triggers on paraphrased requests
- ❌ Doesn't trigger on unrelated topics

**Example test suite:**

```
Should trigger:
- "Help me set up a new ProjectHub workspace"
- "I need to create a project in ProjectHub"
- "Initialize a ProjectHub project for Q4 planning"

Should NOT trigger:
- "What's the weather in San Francisco?"
- "Help me write Python code"
- "Create a spreadsheet" (unless ProjectHub skill handles sheets)
```

#### 2. Functional tests

**Goal:** Verify the skill produces correct outputs.

**Test cases:**

- Valid outputs generated
- API calls succeed
- Error handling works
- Edge cases covered

**Example:**

```
Test: Create project with 5 tasks
Given: Project name "Q4 Planning", 5 task descriptions
When: Skill executes workflow
Then:
  - Project created in ProjectHub
  - 5 tasks created with correct properties
  - All tasks linked to project
  - No API errors
```

#### 3. Performance comparison

**Goal:** Prove the skill improves results vs. baseline.

Use the metrics from [Define Success Criteria](#define-success-criteria). Here's what a comparison might look like.

**Baseline comparison:**

```
Without skill:
- User provides instructions each time
- 15 back-and-forth messages
- 3 failed API calls requiring retry
- 12,000 tokens consumed
```

```
With skill:
- Automatic workflow execution
- 2 clarifying questions only
- 0 failed API calls
- 6,000 tokens consumed
```

### Using the skill-creator skill

The `skill-creator` skill - available in Claude.ai via plugin directory or download for Claude Code - can help you build and iterate on skills. If you have an MCP server and know your top 2-3 workflows, you can build and test a functional skill in a single sitting - often in 15-30 minutes.

**Creating skills:**

- Generate skills from natural language descriptions
- Produce properly formatted SKILL.md with frontmatter
- Suggest trigger phrases and structure

**Reviewing skills:**

- Flag common issues (vague descriptions, missing triggers, structural problems)
- Identify potential over/under-triggering risks
- Suggest test cases based on the skill's stated purpose

**Iterative improvement:**

- After using your skill and encountering edge cases or failures, bring those examples back to skill-creator
- Example: "Use the issues & solution identified in this chat to improve how the skill handles [specific edge case]"

**To use:**

```
"Use the skill-creator skill to help me build a skill for [your use case]"
```

*Note: skill-creator helps you design and refine skills but does not execute automated test suites or produce quantitative evaluation results.*

### Iteration based on feedback

Skills are living documents. Plan to iterate based on:

**Undertriggering signals:**

- Skill doesn't load when it should
- Users manually enabling it
- Support questions about when to use it

> **Solution:** Add more detail and nuance to the description - this may include keywords particularly for technical terms

**Overtriggering signals:**

- Skill loads for irrelevant queries
- Users disabling it
- Confusion about purpose

> **Solution:** Add negative triggers, be more specific

**Execution issues:**

- Inconsistent results
- API call failures
- User corrections needed

> **Solution:** Improve instructions, add error handling
